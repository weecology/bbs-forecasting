\title{Single wrapper for all database actions}
\usage{
db_engine(action, db = "./data/bbsforecasting.sqlite", sql_query = NULL,
  df = NULL, new_table_name = NULL, table_to_check = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{action}{Action to perform in db call. Either read, write, or check}

\item{db}{name of database. A file if using sqlite}

\item{sql_query}{SQL statement if action is read}

\item{df}{Dataframe of data if action is write. Will copy the dataframe verbatim to it's own table with name new_table_name}

\item{new_table_name}{Table name for new data being written}

\item{table_to_check}{Table name to check if it exists for when action is check}
}
\description{
We require only a few simple sql methods. They are 1. Writing an entire dataframe
directly to a database as it's own table, 2. Reading the same tables as dataframes,
possibly with some modification using SQL statements, 3. Checking to see if a
table exists. If a particular table does it exists it's assumed it has all data
required.
}
\details{
read returns a dataframe
write returns nothing
check returns boolean
}
