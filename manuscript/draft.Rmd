## Introduction

Quality of predictions from SDMs is important:
  * helps determine policy/set priorities
  * something something climate change
  * need to know both accuracy of point estimates and how reasonable our prediction intervals are.
  * Overconfident predictions can be worse than uncertainty
SDM assumptions:
  * we've measured all the important variables (sites don't have any other important properties)
  * Something like stationarity:
    * e.g. "systems are at equilibrium now and will be at equilibrium in future"
    * or "species track predictor variables quickly" (no lags)
    * etc
  * independent/identically distributed observations across species, years
  * Space substitutes well for time
Difficult to test SDM assumptions/predictions because of time scales
  * Most scientists making predictions today will have retired by 2050
  * Use long-term data sets such as BBS to evaluate predictive skill
    * Note the large change in average temperatures since the 80's; comparable to the changes expected in the next N years
  * Test with simple baselines (e.g. random walk, future-is-like-present)
  * Focus on richness because... reasons.

## Methods

**Data**

* BBS + retriever
* Monthly climate data from interpolated weather stations
* NDVI
* Altitude

**Models**

* Mixed model for observer effort \& site effects
* Naive AR1 model (adjusted for observer effects)
* species-level GBM w/ mixed model point estimates as bonus predictors where available
* richness-level GBM w/ mixed model point estimates as bonus predictors where available

(need a side note about why we're not using a proper count distribution; underdispersion)

**Evaluation**

* (R)MSE
* Log-likelihood (simultaneously rewards good point estimates, precision, and coverage)
* Coverage at 95%
* Calibration/bias
* Evaluated each year after the last training year
* Dig around in the residuals for insights

## Results and conclusions

* Temporal richness variability doesn't track the predictors we use; sites have "inertia"
* More important to use a reasonable error model than to get the best predictors \& basis expansions
* We've posted predictions for the next N years of BBS data, using several methods
* In many ways, this is the best-case scenario for SDMs:
  * large data set, known \& consistent sampling technique over a period of decades
  * True absences
  * extended predictor set
  * birds arguably migrate quickly enough to make equlibrium \& especially space-for-time assumptions less ridiculous
  * errors for individual species can cancel out; only asking for aggregate values
* Value of stacking versus predicting the quantitity of interest directly
*
